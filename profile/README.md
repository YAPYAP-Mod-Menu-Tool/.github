# YAPYAP Mod Menu

There is a moment in every game when you wish the rules would loosen their grip.
**YAPYAP Mod Menu** exists precisely for that moment — not as a hammer, but as a set of finely tuned instruments. It opens a quiet backstage door where mechanics can be adjusted, paused, accelerated, or softened, all without tearing the fabric of the experience.

This is not chaos.
This is **control**.

## 🌊 Overview

YAPYAP Mod Menu is an external gameplay modification tool that provides a **live in-game menu** for adjusting core systems in real time. Instead of relying on hotkeys alone, everything is laid out visually — switches, sliders, and values waiting for your touch.

It’s designed for players who want to *see* what they change, who enjoy tuning the game like a delicate machine rather than flipping blind switches.

## ✨ What Makes the Mod Menu Different?

Some tools live outside the screen.
This one lives *within* it.

* Visual menu instead of memorized hotkeys
* Organized sections for fast navigation
* Adjustable sliders instead of fixed presets
* Minimal overlay that never steals focus
* Built for experimentation, not brute force

It feels less like cheating… and more like *editing reality*.
